"""The installation: its print farm and first-run setup.

The print farm is ArtisanHub Farm (OpenPrintHQ), the only farm the hub supports. First-run setup records it once
the farm is connected. Invariants 3 and 4: the hub is complete without the installer, and the setup API lives in the
hub. First-run setup goes through /api/setup/v1, used both by the hub's own /setup page and by the installer from
outside.

An installation set up with a farm the hub no longer supports refuses to start (UnsupportedFarm), so it keeps
running its previous version until it has moved to ArtisanHub Farm. Nothing about it is changed or guessed.
