"""The print farm, whichever app runs it (2026-10-22).

The hub talks to its farm only through this interface. Two drivers: Watchtower (clients/watchtower_api.py) and,
later, OpenPrintHQ. Each driver lists the capabilities it has; a hub feature that needs one checks
`farm().has(...)` (or catches FarmUnsupported) and hides or adapts itself instead of failing.

Shapes follow Watchtower's public API v1 for now, since that is what the hub already reads; the OpenPrintHQ
driver maps its answers to the same shapes.
