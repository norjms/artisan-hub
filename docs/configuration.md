# Configuration

Artisan Hub reads its settings from environment variables. Each setting is named `HUB_` followed by the
name in upper case, so `public_url` is `HUB_PUBLIC_URL`. With docker compose, put them in an env file and
load it with `env_file:` (see `compose.example.yml`).

Defaults are neutral. A fresh hub connects to nothing it was not told about: a setting left empty turns its
feature off, and the matching page says it is not configured. Most connections to other services (print farm,
Spoolman, Manyfold, InvenTree, WooCommerce, AI providers) are made per team in the web UI under
**Connections**. The `HUB_` settings for those services are optional fallbacks and seeds for new teams.

Never commit a filled-in env file. Settings marked *secret* below hold credentials.
