"""Which of the farm's printers each person may see and send to.

One installation, one team, one set of printers everyone shares. The owner may narrow that per person on People:
all printers (the default, also for every new person) or a chosen list. Owners, the hub owner and keys that belong
to no person (the installer's, a service's) always have all of them.

The hub keeps the list (Membership.printers: None for all, else printer keys) and applies it wherever it shows or
acts on a printer: a printer outside someone's list is left out of every listing and answers 404 when asked for by
name. It also hands the list to ArtisanHub Farm (push), which applies it in its own pages and its print host, so
OrcaSlicer only offers a person their own printers.

A printer's key is the farm's printer id when the farm has one, else its name.
