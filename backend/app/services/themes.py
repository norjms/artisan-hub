"""The person's look: a named theme and a "reduce transparency" choice, saved on their hub account.

The themes come from the shared design package (artisanhub-ui). glass-dark is the only one today; the names exist so
that a light or high-contrast theme can be added without changing anything that stores or reads the choice.

Earlier hubs saved a "skin" and a light or dark "mode". Those are gone: every
saved value, known or not, becomes glass-dark (migrate_prefs, run once at startup by db.init_db).
